# Incidents

Defects that reached a user or a published release, kept as the eval set for every review layer ("incidents are the
eval", from the Claude Code team's code review write-up, 2026-10-26). A row is added in the same change that fixes
the defect: the fix commit, the commit that introduced it when known, the earliest layer that should have caught it,
and the test or gate that catches it now. `scripts/audit_incidents.py` (run by `scripts/check.sh` and the Security
Checks job) fails a row whose commit does not resolve, whose layer is not one of the names below, or whose catcher is
not defined in the code.

A catcher is written in backticks and is one of: the exact name of a Bats `@test` under `tests/`, a Go `Test*`
function in a `_test.go` file, a Python `test_*` function under `tests/` or `scripts/`, or the repository path of a
gate script (for example `scripts/audit_timeout_status.py`). A Bats name that holds a `|` cannot sit in this table;
rename the test.

Layers, earliest first:

- `write-time`: the author's own check before committing, a sweep of same-shape sites and the source gates, plus the
  `.githooks/pre-commit` hook.
- `check`: `./scripts/check.sh --no-format` (ShellCheck, golangci-lint, the `scripts/audit_*.py` gates), locally and
  in the Check workflow.
- `unit`: the Bats suite through `./scripts/test.sh` and `go test ./...`, locally and in the Validation workflow on
  macos-latest.
- `compat`: the Validation workflow's macos-15 and macos-26 Bats subset, the only lane that sees another macOS
  version's tool output.
- `review`: a diff review, the line-by-line review AGENTS.md requires for destructive sinks, or the weekly audit.
- `e2e`: `scripts/e2e_macos.py` on a real Mac before a release.
- `release`: the release-flow pre-flight and `release.yml` (minimum-OS check, Nix, Homebrew).
- `field`: only a real user's machine, network or configuration shows it.

When a review skill, its prompt or the model running it changes, rerun it on the files each fix touched as they were
at `<Fixed>^` and record which rows it finds (`.claude/skills/weekly-audit`, Phase 3). `Introduced` is a commit only
when it was confirmed by reading the history, otherwise `unknown`.
